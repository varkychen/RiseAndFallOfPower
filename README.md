Rise And Fall Of Power
======================
Implementations of n^n.

2/7/2013
--------
Presently, there are 3 working implementations and one which is in progress

Working Implementations
-----------------------
1. Brute Force Method - This is the easiest implementations, multiplying n with itself n times
2. Divide and Conquer Method - Recursive implementation of n^n
3. Divide and Conquer 2 - Implementations in a while loop

On-going Implementation
-----------------------
1. Addition in Arrays - Rather than doing multiple multiplications, doing repeated additions
